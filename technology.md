# Technologies Used
The Technology used for this project will be Python, PostGres and Tableau

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using different functions in Python.
For example to drop null values, drop any unnecessary columns, checking the types, updating the clean data into new dataframe. 

## Database Storage
PostGres is the database we will be using. We will be saving our final data in CSV, and we will integrate Tableau to CSV.

## Machine Learning
We will be using supervised machine learning.
SciKitLearn is the ML library for python. It has many modules including one for linear regression and LabEncoder for SVM (Support Vector Machine), a binary classifier.
We will work by seperating two classes in a dataset with the widest possible margins. We will:
* Split the data into input (X) and output (y).
* Create a train model
* Create predictions
* Validate the model

## Dashboard
We will be using Tableau as our dashboard. We will integerate our final csv file from pandas to display our findings. The dashboard will include different factor
analysis and the relation between them and how one factor effects the other. For example relation between new vaccinations vs new icu admissions or new deaths.

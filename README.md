## What, Why and How
  The COVID-19 pandemic upended lives, the status quo and most global operations. Clean, reliable data is more crucial than ever as it provides insights into how variables correlate, and what measures can be taken to mitigate preventable deaths/sickness. Our goal is to find how vaccines impact the severity of covid-19 infection, which in our case is death counts.
 Our team developed a machine learning model to infer the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine and natural immunity using data from OurWorldInData. For vaccinations, we focused solely on fully vaccinated and covid boosters, as there are very few individuals who receive just one shot. 

Our tools included: Python/Jupyter Notebook, PostgreSQL /pgAdmin 4, Sklearn/Pandas, and Tableau. 

The variables we chose to focus on/compare included: Fully vaccinated, Booster shots, ICU Patients, and Deaths

Our data on COVID-19 was scraped from multiple sources found through this link: (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus).

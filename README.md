### COVID

## Purpose

Using a COVID 19 dataset obtained as of February 28, 2022 from [OurworldinData](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), analyze and develop machine learning models that correlates COVID new vaccinations, ICU Patients, and Deaths to infer the effectiveness of vaccinations and natural immunity. 

## Deliverable One Role Assignments:

- Square - Bryan
- Triangle - Maliha
- Circle -Michael
- X - Ling
